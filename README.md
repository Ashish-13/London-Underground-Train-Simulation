# London-Underground-Train-Simulation

Project description:
Create a simulation for the London-Birmingham (5 stations) section of the high-speed line under assumption of a number k of signaling blocks. A decision on the number of signaling blocks is required, as the track laying is supposed to start soon. Also, a decision on the number of trains running per hour must be made.
Depending on the number of signaling blocks simulate the throughput of trains.
